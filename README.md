# ePrint Signature Audit

An AI-assisted campaign to identify and practically audit digital signature schemes
published on the IACR Cryptology ePrint Archive for which no prior public attack
against the scheme was located.

The project counts only practical, full-parameter, design-level signing compromises:
secret-key recovery with fresh signing, equivalent signing-key or witness recovery
with fresh signing, or efficient fresh-message forgery. Known cryptanalytic methods
are welcome when their application to the target scheme appears previously
unreported.

## Verified attacks

No attack has passed the publication gate yet.

The first catalog record is ATLAS (ePrint 2026/2323), excluded because it is
the published form of MORNING-ATLAS/NGCC sign-15 and a practical ATLAS-128
equivalent-key recovery with fresh-message forgery is already public.

ECLIPSE (ePrint 2026/2312) received a scoped paper-level audit after a
scheme-specific search, including its unnamed Section 5 PRISM identity, located
no prior public attack as of 2026-10-07. Tests of its structured-primality,
scalar-verifier, canonical-encoding, derived-key, and deterministic-stream
surfaces found no practical full-parameter signing compromise. The exact
implementation remains private, so source-specific decoder and serializer
checks are reserved for a release-time recheck.

ASTRA-Sign (ePrint 2026/1290 v2) completed a scoped audit with no practical
signing compromise. QC-pooled transcript statistics, sparse-ratio and CRT
recovery, exact coordinate descent, and refined q-ary PGE/GBA/dissection
estimates all screened negative under the project gate. Its only nominal
sub-128 list-work point requires about `2^126.90` stored entries, and
memory-feasible variants remain above `2^132.85` elementary work.

miniMEDS (ePrint 2026/1323 v1) and Miraidon-S (ePrint 2026/997 v4) remain under
technical audit after target-specific searches located no public attacks
against those exact parameterized schemes. miniMEDS is distinct from its
publicly cryptanalyzed MEDS predecessor, while Miraidon-S already accounts for
the known fixed-weight five-pass forgery methods used against related
protocols. The audit carries those lineage attacks forward without treating
them as attacks on the exact targets.

Lithium (ePrint 2026/1790 v1) completed a scoped audit with no practical
signing compromise. Its mode-260 challenge sampler uses one-byte indices at
degree 512, making 198 challenge positions unreachable and lowering a generic
zero-response target-preimage forgery to about `2^203.66` message trials. This
is a specification-level claim-margin failure, but it remains computationally
infeasible and is not classified as a successful attack by this project.

UFOs (ePrint 2026/1607 v1) keeps the publicly attacked Frobenius-UOV
construction but replaces the exponent schedules used by the known forgery.
The predecessor attack was reproduced at reduced characteristic, then the
replacement Level-I schedule was exhaustively screened under the published
attack model. No practical full-parameter signing compromise was found. The
catalog preserves the attacked lineage and a narrow recheck for the unpublished
hardening analysis.
